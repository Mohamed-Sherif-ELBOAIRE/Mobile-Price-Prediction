# Mobile-Price-Prediction 

## Data<br>
The mobile price classification dataset is a dataset containing various attributes of mobile phones, which can be used to build a machine learning model for predicting price ranges of mobile devices.<br>
The dataset includes features such as:<br>
● Id : ID.<br>
● battery_power : Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh.<br>
● blue : Has bluetooth or not.<br>
● clock_speed : speed at which microprocessor executes instructions.<br>
● dual_sim : Has dual sim support or not.<br>
● fc : Front Camera megapixels.<br>
● four_g : Has 4G or not.<br>
● int_memory : Internal Memory in Gigabytes.<br>
● m_dep : Mobile Depth in cm.<br>
● mobile_wt : Weight of mobile phone.<br>
● n_cores : Number of cores of processor.<br>
● pc : Primary Camera megapixels.<br>
● px_height : Pixel Resolution Height.<br>
● px_width : Pixel Resolution Width.<br>
● ram : Random Access Memory in Megabytes.<br>
● sc_h : Screen Height of mobile in cm.<br>
● sc_w : Screen Width of mobile in cm<br>
● talk_time : longest time that a single battery charge will last.<br>
● three_g : has 3g or not.<br>
● touch_screen : Has touch screen or not<br>
● wifi : has wifi or not.<br>
● price_range: This is the target variable with values of 0(low cost), 1(medium cost),
2(high cost) and 3(very high cost).<br>

## Objective<br>
The objective of this classification task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price range of a mobile phone based on its various attributes. <br>
The dataset can be used to train and evaluate the model's performance in accurately classifying mobile prices.<br>
By analyzing this dataset, candidates are required to follow machine learning workflow particularly by:<br>
● Exploring the data and providing descriptive statistics.<br>
● Performing data visualization. (provide comments on each graph)<br>
● Applying necessary data transformations and feature engineering. (provide justification
for each step)<br>
● Performing feature selection to select most related features.<br>
● Trying training more than one classification model using “train.csv” and performing<br>
hyperparameter tuning.<br>
● Evaluating models on training and testing data by providing classification scores like<br>
accuracy, precision, recall ,f1-score, etc.. (provide your comments about results)<br>
● Selecting the best model and saving it as a pkl file.<br>
